# AntColonyProject
I was provided a GUI to use for this project and required to build it in IntelliJ IDEA.

This is an ant colony simulation that shows how an ant colony with certain specifications will behave.

The foragers search discovered areas for food to bring to the queen, the scouts explore new areas so the foragers have places to explore, the soldiers fight the enemy ants, and the queen hatches new ants.

The foragers move randomly unless pheromones are present near them and if they find food, they leave pheromones.

The scouts and enemy ants move completely randomly.

The soldiers move randomly unless a node by them has an enemy ant.

Once you build and run the project, make sure the GUI is full screen.

# To Run:

The GUI I was provided is very large so its better to scroll down to the center of it and click Normal Setup in the header area.

After the board has been set up, click Run
